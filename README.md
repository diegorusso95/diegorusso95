<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Diego</h1>

I'm a PhD student in **Technology, Innovation and Management (TIM)** at the University of Bergamo (UniBg), where I research **Recommender Systems**. My work focuses on creating transparent AI frameworks that build user trust and improve recommendation reliability. Iâ€™m especially interested in understanding and mitigating the impact of recommendations on **Online Social Networks**, including effects like echo chambers and polarization.

### ðŸŽ¯ Research Interests & Focus
- **Explainable Recommender Systems**: Developing frameworks that make recommendations more interpretable and trustworthy.
- **User Behavior & Social Impact**: Analyzing user interactions to address risks such as filter bubbles, echo chambers, and radicalization.
- **Deep Learning for Recommendations**: Utilizing **TensorFlow** and **PyTorch** to experiment with neural networks in recommendation engines.
